# CS330 Final Project Reflection

## How do I approach designing software?

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I learned that sometimes, the easiest option is to fake shapes by using a combination of meshes rather than using a single mesh that feels more correct.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?

The trial and error approach. I tried doing math, but most of my math seemed to scoot things off in the wrong direction or wrong size. I then would take a best guess nudge in the right direction and make math adjustments to get things in the correct position that I wanted them. An example would be the required rotation of the torus that was the handle of my mug. I did not have an intuition on how that would appear in the scene, so I had to guess and check running and altering the program to flip the handle the correct way.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I use guess and check along with some math sprinkled on top all the time. Everything from how tall components should be in websites I design to how late on a Friday I can push to prod. Sometimes just winging it and seeing what it looks like works well. (just kidding on the pushing to prod late on a friday by the way).

## How do I approach developing programs?

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I let myself have fun with the process and let my design mind run free. I usually have to plan the things I build quite extensively for them to work, it was nice just trying things and having fun with the project.

### How did iteration factor into your development?

I use git locally to iterate, test out new things, and roll things back when necessary. Sometimes when I'm feeling spicy, I will throw my code up on github to get those little green squares.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?

I don't think it has too much. I enjoy coding. I dislike Windows, but it wasn't as painful as I thought it was going to be. Visual Studios has Vim motions so it wasn't that bad. I don't need the power of Visual Studio for my own projects, but it is nice to have experience with debugging in it if I ever need to again.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

So many jobs require a degree to even be considered, and with LLMs reading more and more resumes, being able to slap that near perfect gpa and a masters in CS with a focus in ML will look pretty snazzy to the robot. I feel I get more out of exploring my own curiosities than assignments, but assignments that encourage my curiosities help scratch that itch and help me learn so much more.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I want to work in robotics. I saw a job posting just yesterday that said they needed someone who knew how to use OpenGL. I would probably make a new project altogether as I discovered I was using deprecated functions throughout my code and should probably show more modern and cleaner code than this project. I will certainly take what I learned and apply it to the next project that I make to try and get myself into the robotics field.
